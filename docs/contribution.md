# Contributing Concepts, Sketches, and Ideas to Voidbound

If you have concepts, sketches, or ideas that enhance the game's concept, atmosphere, and narrative, but are not directly related to code or in-game resources, this guide will help you understand how to contribute effectively.

## How to Contribute

1. **Brainstorm and Ideation:** Begin by brainstorming concepts, sketches, or ideas that align with Voidbound's cyberpunk atmosphere and Greek mythology-inspired theme. Think about characters, enemies, environments, dialogue, and storytelling.

2. **Detailed Descriptions:** Provide detailed descriptions of your concepts and ideas. Include character personalities, visual traits, background stories, enemy behaviors, and interactions. The more information you provide, the clearer your contribution will be to the development team.

3. **Sketches and Visuals:** Accompany your descriptions with rough sketches, visual references, or mood boards, if possible. These visuals help convey your ideas effectively and assist artists and designers in understanding your vision.

4. **Documentation Format:** Create a markdown file (`.md`) for your contributions. Use headings, bullet points, and images to organize your concepts.

## Submission Process

1. **Fork the Repository:** Fork the Voidbound repository on GitHub to create your copy of the project.

2. **Create a New Branch:** In your forked repository, create a new branch dedicated to your contributions. Choose a descriptive branch name related to your content.

3. **Organize Your Concepts:** Inside the `docs/concepts` folder of your branch, organize your contributions into folders based on their categories. For example, create folders like `characters`, `enemies`, `environments`, etc.

4. **Add Your Content:** Inside the appropriate folders, add your markdown files containing your concepts, sketches, and ideas.

5. **Commit and Push:** Commit your changes with clear commit messages. Push the changes to your branch in the forked repository.

6. **Submit a Pull Request:** Open a pull request (PR) from your branch in the forked repository to the relevant branch in the original Voidbound repository. In the PR description, briefly summarize your contributions and explain how they enhance the game's concept.

## Collaboration and Feedback

1. **Review and Feedback:** Someone will review your pull request and provide feedback. Be open to iterating on your concepts based on suggestions.

2. **Discussion:** Engage in discussions related to your contributions. Address questions, clarify points, and refine your ideas as needed.
